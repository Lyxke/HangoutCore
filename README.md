# Hangout Core
This Spigot plugin is for a friend group's Minecraft server.

This plugin contains ideas that several of the server members had so that I could practice Java programming.

You may use the code here for reference and for study, but not for direct usage (I.e., copy/paste).

## Future/Current Plans
This plugin will be renamed shortly. The plugin will also be brought to the latest version of Spigot. The plugin is also now compiled with Adoptium JDK 17.

First Version: HangoutCore, 2020

Second, and current, Version: Sandout, 2023
